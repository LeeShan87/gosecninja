# GoSecNinja

This project is inspired by:

- [awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)
- [awesome-go](https://github.com/avelino/awesome-go)
- [awesome-security](https://github.com/sbilly/awesome-security)

## Why this project exists?
I have been thinking for a long time about how we should make the internet a safer, better place.

And I found that it's a complicated problem to solve. It should be an open-source solution. It should be available for everyone.
And it should be a community where we all help each other because we are all victims and need help. 
I had a tough time finding like-minded communities and people. So I want to honor you.
## Goals

- Connect people who need help with communities that could assist.
- Share awesome projects that need more attention and help them to be more awesome.
